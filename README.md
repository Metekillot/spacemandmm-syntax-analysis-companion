# SpacemanDMM Syntax Analysis Companion

This application is reliant upon the functionality of https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM and would not exist without it.

This application is meant to hook into the low-level data parsing of SpacemanDMM to offer a CLI or serialized interface for inspection of the types and syntax of a given Dreammaker project -- most relevantly, the /tg/station fork of Space Station 13 that you can find here https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation -- to assist with:

* Holistic understanding of a given codebase
* Facilitating cross-repository porting and sharing of code while lessening the often arduous cognitive load of checking every file in a given merge or cherry-pick
* Further functional tbd
